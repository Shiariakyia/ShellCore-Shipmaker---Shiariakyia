Please note that I plan to update the codes to be functional with latest Gamemaker version in this branch, so once finished it will be pushed to the main branch and merged...


In this project, I have attempted to emulate the original mechanics of ShellCore Command's ship assembly function from the era of it's infant as a Flash Game, the first of its games released during 2009 - 2011 by an author went under the name of "Flashbacker". 

It has also the function to generates JSON string to be imported directly into the ShellCore Command Remastered, although it is possible to use the Shipmaker to generates ShellCore design codes to put into player-made maps and scenario on the SCC Remastered side, please note that the development of the Shipmaker is still ongoing and that features related to integrations with SCC Remastered Projects were not yet completed.

And since this project's original purposes initially didn't have anything to do with other fan-made games, this is why there are some shell parts included which does not exist in either of those other fan-made projects, so do not expect this to become universal tool for your need, but you are feel free to fork from this.

However any commercial uses derivatives away from this repository is not authorized and will likely deem illegal to be used in such context if done without permission.
